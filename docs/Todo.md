# To-Do

## 10/22/2023 - Caelan
1. Need to add classes for events, commands, and telemetry.
2. Parser should be able to handle all of the above classes and ports and should be able to instantiate their respective class objects.
3. A clean implementation for Handling @ comments as descriptions.
4. Some form of basic script validation. For example, not allowing invalid characters or not having required structures such as module {}.
